        Each plant type has optimal daily sun exposure:
        ├─ Herbs/microgreens: 12-14 hours direct sun
        ├─ Leafy greens: 10-12 hours, tolerate partial shade
        ├─ Fruiting plants: 8-10 hours direct, prefer morning sun
        ├─ Root vegetables: 6-8 hours, afternoon shade beneficial

        Revolutionary extension: Drone-carried growing platforms
        
        Concept:
        ├─ Large cargo drones (heavy-lift quadcopters)
        ├─ Carry modular growing platforms (1-2 m²)
        ├─ Platforms have growing medium, plants, micro-irrigation
        ├─ Drones position platforms optimally in 3D space
        ├─ Not confined to rings—any position possible
        ├─ Ultra-precise environmental optimization
        └─ Maximum flexibility and space utilization
        
        Applications:
        ├─ Fill gaps in ring structure (maximize growing area)
        ├─ Experimental plots (test new techniques)
        ├─ High-value crops (saffron, vanilla - need perfect conditions)
        ├─ Pollination optimization (move platforms near pollinators)
        ├─ Aesthetic arrangements (decorative, tours, events)
        └─ Research (controlled experiments)
        
        Challenges:
        ├─ Heavy-lift drones expensive (50-100kg lift capacity)
        ├─ Flight time limited (5-15 minutes with load)
        ├─ Frequent repositioning increases complexity
        ├─ Platform irrigation/power (wireless or tethered)
        └─ Cost-benefit analysis (rings may be more economical)
        
        Verdict:
        ├─ Feasible for specialized applications
        ├─ Demonstration value (showcase innovation)

        The Farmdominium represents more than agricultural innovation—
        it symbolizes humanity's ability to live in harmony with nature 
        even in dense urban environments.
        
        It demonstrates that:
        ├─ Technology and nature can integrate beautifully
        ├─ Cities can produce food, not just consume it
        ├─ Automation frees humans from drudgery while connecting us to Earth
        ├─ Sustainability and abundance are compatible
        ├─ Beauty and function are inseparable
        └─ The future of food is bright, rotating, and green
        
        Every farmdominium built is a statement:
        "We choose abundance. We choose sustainability. We choose beauty.
        We choose a future where every person has access to fresh,
        nutritious food grown in harmony with our planet."
        
        The rotating gardens of tomorrow start with the first farmdominium today.
        
        Let us build it.

    The farmdominium is not merely a structure—it is a paradigm.
    
    It rejects the false choice between productivity and beauty,
    between technology and nature, between urban and agricultural.
    
    It demonstrates that the future of food is:
    ├─ Abundant (high yields per area)
    ├─ Efficient (minimal inputs, maximum outputs)
    ├─ Sustainable (carbon negative, water conserving)
    ├─ Accessible (urban proximity)
    ├─ Resilient (distributed, climate-independent)
    ├─ Educational (visible, engaging)
    ├─ Beautiful (aesthetic, inspiring)
    └─ Democratic (community-owned, open-source)
    
    Every rotating ring carries hope.
    Every cascade of water carries nutrients and possibility.
    Every autonomous drone carries humanity's potential.
    Every harvest carries nourishment and dignity.
    
    The farmdominium rotates not just plants, but perspectives.
    
    It shows us what is possible when we combine:
    Ancient wisdom (companion planting, water harvesting)
    Modern engineering (robotics, sensors, AI)
    Future vision (sustainable abundance for all)
    
    We can feed cities from within cities.
    We can make agriculture beautiful.
    We can automate without dehumanizing.
    We can produce abundantly without depleting.
    
    The farmdominium proves it.
    
    Now we must build it.
    Everywhere.
    
    For everyone.
    
    The future of food is rotating.
    The future is now.
    
    Let the gardens rise.
    Let them spin.
    Let them feed the world.
