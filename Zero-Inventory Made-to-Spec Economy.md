    One app replaces dozens of traditional applications:
    
    Traditional Fragmentation:
    ├─ Banking app
    ├─ Payment apps (Venmo, PayPal, etc.)
    ├─ Shopping apps (Amazon, etc.)
    ├─ Food delivery apps
    ├─ Ride-sharing apps
    ├─ Social media apps (multiple)
    ├─ News apps
    ├─ Healthcare apps
    ├─ Education apps
    ├─ Government services apps
    ├─ Community event apps
    ├─ Fitness tracking apps
    └─ 20+ different apps, accounts, passwords
    
    EDS Universal App:
    └─ ONE app with integrated modules
        ├─ Financial (wallet, transactions, treasury)
        ├─ Commerce (marketplace, services)
        ├─ Community (social, events, communication)
        ├─ Governance (voting, proposals, participation)
        ├─ Services (healthcare, education, logistics)
        ├─ Information (news, directory, AequMap)
        ├─ Personal (profile, credentials, history)
        └─ Coordination (pledges, projects, collaboration)
    
    Benefits:
    ├─ One login (blockchain identity)
    ├─ Seamless integration between functions
    ├─ Unified data (privacy-preserving)
    ├─ Consistent interface
    ├─ Offline capability
    ├─ Universal access
    └─ Zero friction

    EDS enables focus on longevity that capitalism cannot:
